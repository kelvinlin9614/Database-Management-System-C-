    Bugs     : No bugs so far

    Reflections: In this final project, I think i implemented all the functions
                 except the delete function in the table class.
                 This is the biggest project that I have ever done. I remembered
                 the most confused part is the shunting yard and rpn functions.
                 That was a new stuff for me. I was totally lost when I wrote
                 this function. Luckily, I spent about 3 days to figure out
                 that with my friend's help.
                 The other confused part is the constructor of the table class.
                 especially the constructor that open an existing table.
                 when i use the get_record to get the vector of field name, it
                 will return a vector with a wrong size. That was took me a
                 lot of time to find this problem.
